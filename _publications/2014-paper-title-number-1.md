title: "An Extension of FBS Three-Phase Power Flow for Handling PV Nodes in Active Distribution Networks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2014-paper-title-number-1

excerpt: 'Forward/backward sweep power flow (FBS) is widely used in distribution network analysis because it is very efficient for radial and weakly meshed networks. In these types of methods, sensitivity-based approaches are commonly used to account for PV nodes in active distribution system; however, the convergence deteriorates as the number of PV nodes increases, and may even diverge for large-branch R/X ratios.
